## 🎮 What Is the Cheat Menu?

The **Cheat Menu** is a real-time in-game overlay that injects powerful features into the Among Us client. It lets you toggle hacks on and off while playing, giving you access to **god-tier tools** like wallhacks, teleportation, vote manipulation, and full role visibility. It works on private lobbies, custom servers, and even LAN rooms.
